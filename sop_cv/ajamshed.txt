PROJECTS/SOFTWARE

1. AETHER PROJECT                                         Feb 2020-Aug 2020
Aether is the first open source 5G Connected Edge platform for enabling
enterprise digital transformation. It provides mobile connectivity and
edge cloud services for distributed enterprise networks as a cloud managed
offering. Aether is an open source platform optimized for multi-cloud
deployments, and simultaneous support for wireless connectivity over
licensed, unlicensed and lightly-licensed (CBRS) spectrum.
- Role: Lead author and maintainer of Aether UPF

- Source code: https://github.com/omec-project/upf

2. OMEC PROJECT	                                          Feb 2019-Aug 2020
The Open Mobile Evolved Core (OMEC) project is an initiative from the Open
Networking Foundation (ONF) to create an open source virtualized evolved
packet core for 4G/LTE networks. OMEC comprises of a number of VNFs
including (i) OpenMME: a Mobility Management Entity function, (ii) C3PO:
a suite packaging Home Subscription Service (HSS), Database, Charge Data
Function (CDF), Charge Trigger Function (CTF), and Policy Control Rules
Function (PCRF), and (iii) ngic-rtc: a control user plane separated (CUPS)
3GPP TS23501 based Service and Packet gateway functions. OMEC won the Intel
Division Recognition Award 2019.

3. mOS STACK                                              May 2016-Mar 2019
The mOS networking stack provides elegant abstractions for stateful flow
processing tailored for middlebox applications. Our API allows developers
to focus on the core application logic while it relieves the burden of
dealing with low-level packet/flow processing themselves. Under the hood,
the stack implements an efficient event system derived from mTCP, a high
performance user-level TCP/IP stack. mOS won the NSDI Best Paper Award 2017.
- Role: Lead author & maintainer

4. PACKET BRICKS                                        Sept 2014-Jun 2016
A netmap-based packet layer for distributing and filtering traffic.
- Role: Lead author & maintainer

5. mTCP                                                 Sept 2013-Nov 2019
mTCP is a high-performance user-level TCP stack for multi-core systems
that addresses the inefficiency from the ground up - from packet I/O and
TCP connection management to the application interface. mTCP (1) allows
efficient flow-level event aggregation, and (2) performs batch processing
of RX/TX packets for high I/O efficiency. mTCP improves the performance
of small message transactions by a factor 25 and 3 than that of the latest
Linux TCP stack and the best-known research prototype. It also improves
the performance of various popular applications by 33% to 320% compared
with those on the Linux stack. mTCP won the NSDI Community Award 2014
and was declared runner-up in the Samsung HumanTech Paper Award 2014.
- Role: Co-author & co-lead maintainer

6. KARGUS							  Oct 2012
Kargus is a highly-scalable software-based network intrusion detection
system (NIDS) that runs on commodity PCs and its performance is comparable
to hardware-based NIDSes. It effectively exploits the potentials of modern
hardware innovations such as multi-core CPUs, heterogeneous GPUs and
multi-queue interface of NICs that drives its monitoring rate by up to 33
Gbps in real time. Kargus was mentioned in the “10 Achievements of 2012
that put KAIST on the Spotlight.”
- Role: Lead author
- Project homepage: http://shader.kaist.edu/kargus/

7. HUMANSIGN							 Sept 2010
An input device framework in which keystroke events are securely coupled
with text-based content that is typed by humans with the end goal of
reliable network payload delivery. This scheme is based on trusted
computing principles that places the root of trust on a customized input
device running a trusted platform module (TPM) chip and a small attester
daemon within it. Each input event generates a cryptographic hash that
attests to human activity and the combined message attestation (derived
from such events) gets a third-party verifiable digital signature. These
human attestations are then attached to the actual messages which
ultimately assist in reducing false positive rates in the recipients’
filter modules.
