PROJECTS/SOFTWARE

1. mOS STACK							  May 2016-
The mOS networking stack provides elegant abstractions for stateful flow
processing tailored for middlebox applications. Our API allows developers
to focus on the core application logic while it relieves the burden of
dealing with low-level packet/flow processing themselves. Under the hood,
the stack implements an efficient event system derived from mTCP, a high
performance user-level TCP/IP stack. mOS won the NSDI Best Paper Award 2017.
We plan to move the project to DPDK.org for broader impact. Discussion is
on-going with Intel folks.
- Role: Lead author & maintainer

- Source code: https://github.com/ndsl-kaist/mOS-networking-stack
- Related publication: Refer to our mOS paper at NSDI 2017

2. PACKET BRICKS       	     	    	      	 		 Sept 2014-
A netmap-based packet layer for distributing and filtering traffic.
- Role: Lead author & maintainer
- Source code: https://github.com/bro/packet-bricks

3. mTCP								 Sept 2013-
mTCP is a high-performance user-level TCP stack for multi-core systems
that addresses the inefficiency from the ground up - from packet I/O and
TCP connection management to the application interface. mTCP (1) allows
efficient flow-level event aggregation, and (2) performs batch processing
of RX/TX packets for high I/O efficiency. mTCP improves the performance
of small message transactions by a factor 25 and 3 than that of the latest
Linux TCP stack and the best-known research prototype. It also improves
the performance of various popular applications by 33% to 320% compared
with those on the Linux stack. mTCP won the NSDI Community Award 2014
and was declared runner-up in the Samsung HumanTech Paper Award 2014.
We plan to move the project to DPDK.org for broader impact. Discussion
is on-going with Intel folks.

4. KARGUS							  Oct 2012
Kargus is a highly-scalable software-based network intrusion detection
system (NIDS) that runs on commodity PCs and its performance is comparable
to hardware-based NIDSes. It effectively exploits the potentials of modern
hardware innovations such as multi-core CPUs, heterogeneous GPUs and
multi-queue interface of NICs that drives its monitoring rate by up to 33
Gbps in real time. Kargus was mentioned in the “10 Achievements of 2012
that put KAIST on the Spotlight.”
- Role: Lead author

5. HUMANSIGN							 Sept 2010
An input device framework in which keystroke events are securely coupled
with text-based content that is typed by humans with the end goal of
reliable network payload delivery. This scheme is based on trusted
computing principles that places the root of trust on a customized input
device running a trusted platform module (TPM) chip and a small attester
daemon within it. Each input event generates a cryptographic hash that
attests to human activity and the combined message attestation (derived
from such events) gets a third-party verifiable digital signature. These
human attestations are then attached to the actual messages which
ultimately assist in reducing false positive rates in the recipients’
filter modules.
