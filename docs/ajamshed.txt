PROJECTS/SOFTWARE

1. mOS STACK (https://github.com/ndsl-kaist/mOS-networking-stack) May 2016-
mOS networking stack provides elegant abstractions for stateful
flow processing tailored for middlebox applications. Our API allows
developers to focus on the core application logic instead of dealing
with low-level packet/flow processing themselves. Under the hood, the
stack implements an efficient event system derived from mTCP, a
high-performance user-level TCP/IP stack. Our evaluation demonstrates
that the mOS API enables modular develop- ment of stateful middleboxes,
often significantly reducing development efforts represented by the
source lines of code, while introducing little performance overhead.

2. PACKET BRICKS (https://github.com/bro/packet-bricks)		 Sept 2014-
A netmap-based packet layer for distributing and filtering traffic.

3. mTCP	(https://github.com/eunyoung14/mtcp/)			 Sept 2013-
Scaling the performance of short TCP connections on multi-core systems is 
fundamentally challenging. Although many proposals have attempted to 
address various shortcomings, inefficiency in the kernel implementation 
still persists. For example, even the state-of-the-art design spends 70% 
to 80% of CPU cycles in handling TCP connections in the kernel, leaving
only small room for innovation in the user-level program. mTCP is a 
high-performance user-level TCP stack for multi-core systems that 
addresses the inefficiency from the ground up from packet I/O and TCP 
connection management to the application interface. In addition
to adopting well-known techniques, mTCP (1) allows efficient flow-level 
event aggregation, and (2) performs batch processing of RX/TX packets for 
high I/O efficiency. mTCP improves the performance of small message 
transactions by a factor 25 and 3 than that of latest Linux TCP stack and 
the best-performing prototype we know. It also improves the
performance of various popular applications by 33% to 320% compared with 
those on the Linux stack. mTCP won the NSDI Community Award 2014 and was 
declared runnerup in the Samsung HumanTech Paper Award 2014.

4. KARGUS							  Oct 2012
Intrusion attempts on the Internet have consistently risen in the last few
years. As the link bandwidths of large campus and metropolitan area 
networks reach 10 Gbps, network administrators have employed 
high-performance intrusion detection systems (IDSes) that use dedicated 
network processors and specialized memory to cope with the increasing 
ingress traffic rates. Unfortunately, the deployment and maintenance costs 
of such solutions are inevitably high, and the hardware design is often 
too inflexible to adopt new analysis algorithms. Kargus is a 
highly-scalable software-based IDS that runs on commodity PCs and its
performance is comparable to hardware-based IDSes. It effectively exploits 
the potentials of modern hardware innovations such as multi-core CPUs, 
heterogeneous GPUs and multiqueue interface of NICs that drives its 
monitoring rate by up to 33 Gbps in real time. Kargus was mentioned in 
the "10 Achievements of 2012 that put KAIST on the Spotlight."

5. HUMANSIGN							 Sept 2010
A device framework under development in which input keystroke events are 
securely coupled with actual textual content typed by humans for reliable 
network payload delivery. This scheme is based on trusted computing 
principles that places the root of trust on a customized input device 
running a trusted platform module (TPM) chip and a small attester daemon
within it. Each input event generates a cryptographic hash that attests to 
human activity and the combined message attestation (derived from such 
events) gets a third-party verifiable digital signature. These human 
attestations are then attached to the actual messages which ultimately 
assist in reducing false positive rates in the recipients' filter modules.

6. BOTBUSTER							  Dec 2008
DDoS attacks increasingly use normal-looking application-layer requests to 
waste HTTP server CPU or disk resources. CAPTCHAs attempt to distinguish 
bots from human clients and are often used to avoid such attacks. However, 
CAPTCHAs themselves consume resources and frequently are defeated. I 
developed Bobuster, an extensible ebtables module that pushes client 
authentication in the kernel while overcoming several limitations in 
KillBots (NSDI '05). It can easily be deployed as a bridge in front of 
server farms, modularly accepts a variety of present and future 
authentication schemes, and can do server-directed client authentication 
and packet classification. <Pubs: ICCCN 2008, LCN 2010>
